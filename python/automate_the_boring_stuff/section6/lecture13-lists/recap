- A list is a value that contains multiples values.
- The values in a list are also called items.
- You can access items in a list with it's integer index.
- The indexes start at 0, not 1.
- You can also use negative indexes. -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second to last item, and so on.
- You can get multiple items from the list using a slice.
- The slice has two indexes. The new list's items start at the first index and go up to, but doesn't include, the second index.
- The len() function, concatenation, and replication work the same way with lists that they do with strings.
- You can convert a value into a list by passing it to the list() function.
- "in" and "not in" operators are used in expressions to see if a value is present (or not present) in the list.
