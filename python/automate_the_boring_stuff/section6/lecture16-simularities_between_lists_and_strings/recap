- A list value is a mutable data type; it can be changed.
- A string value is immuatable; it cannot be changed.
- Strings can do a lot of the same things lists can do, but strings are immutable.
- Immutable values like strings and tuples cannot be modified "in place".
- Mutable values like lists can be modified in place.
- Variables don't contain lists, they contain references to lists.
- When passing a list argument to a function, you are actually passing a list reference.
- Changes made to a list in a function will affect the list outside the function.
- The \ line continuation character can be used to stretch Python instructions across multiple lines.


References are explained very well in Ned Batchelder's talk, "Facts and myths about Python names and values":
